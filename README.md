# hello-world
  This is my first time to write something on github by following the introduction. I want to change the font-size and will learn the next step of how to commit these changes to master branch.
  Add some emojicode~ :+1: 
  Lets rename \*our-new-project\* to \*our-old-project\*.
  
  #include <stdio.h>
  
  int main(){
  
  printf("Hello World!\n");
  
  return 0;
  
  }
